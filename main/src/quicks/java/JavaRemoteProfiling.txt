Step 1: 
Make sure the target application is configured to run using Java 6+. Click to update steps for profiling JDK 5 applications.

Step 2: 
If you have not done it before create a Remote profiling pack for the selected OS & JVM and upload it to the remote system. Remote profiling pack root directory will be referred to as <remote>.

Step 3: 
If you have not run profiling on the remote system yet, run the <remote>/bin/calibrate-16.sh script first to calibrate the profiler.

Step 4: 
Add the following parameter(s) to the application startup script (copy to clipboard):
 -XX:+UseLinuxPosixThreadCPUClocks -agentpath:<remote>/lib/deployed/jdk16/linux-amd64/libprofilerinterface.so=<remote>/lib,5140

Step 5: 
Start the target application. The process will wait for the profiler to connect.

Step 6: 
Submit this dialog and click the Attach button to connect to the target application and resume its execution.
