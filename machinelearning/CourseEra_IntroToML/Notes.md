Week 1 Stuff:

Machine Learning is a field that gives computers the ability to
learn w/o explicitly being learned.(Definition by Arthur Samuel)

More recent formulated Definition is by Tom Mitchell(Friend on Carnegie Mellon)
a computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T 
and some performance measure P, 
if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

In case of marking emails as SPAM, 
T is the task of classifying emails
E is watching you/others/self classify SPAM vs not
P is the fraction of emails classified. P will improve with more E 

Learning Algorithms, there are two types of learning algorithms 
Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithms.
Supervised :: We help the computer learn.
Unsupervised :: We let the computer learn by itself.
