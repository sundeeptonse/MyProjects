 * 		   Consider an undirected graph consisting of nodes where
 *         each node is labeled from to and the edge between any two nodes is
 *         always of length . We define node to be the starting position for a
 *         BFS.
 * 
 *         Given queries in the form of a graph and some starting node, ,
 *         perform each query by calculating the shortest distance from starting
 *         node to all the other nodes in the graph. Then print a single line of
 *         space-separated integers listing node 's shortest distance to each of
 *         the other nodes (ordered sequentially by node number); if is
 *         disconnected from a node, print as the distance to that node.
 * 
 *         Input Format
 * 
 *         The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of queries.
 *         The subsequent lines describe each query in the following format:
 * 
 *         The first line contains two space-separated integers describing the
 *         respective values of (the number of nodes) and (the number of edges)
 *         in the graph. Each line of the subsequent lines contains two
 *         space-separated integers, and , describing an edge connecting node to
 *         node . The last line contains a single integer, , denoting the index
 *         of the starting node. Constraints
 * 
 *         Output Format
 * 
 *         For each of the queries, print a single line of space-separated
 *         integers denoting the shortest distances to each of the other nodes
 *         from starting position . These distances should be listed
 *         sequentially by node number (i.e., ), but should not include node .
 *         If some node is unreachable from , print as the distance to that
 *         node.

 * 
 *         6 6 -1 -1 6 Explanation
 * 
 *         We perform the following two queries:
 * 
 *         The given graph can be represented as: graph1 where our start node, ,
 *         is node . The shortest distances from to the other nodes are one edge
 *         to node , one edge to node , and an infinite distance to node (which
 *         it's not connected to). We then print node 's distance to nodes , ,
 *         and (respectively) as a single line of space-separated integers: 6,
 *         6, -1. The given graph can be represented as: graph2 where our start
 *         node, , is node . There is only one edge here, so node is unreachable
 *         from node and node has one edge connecting it to node . We then print
 *         node 's distance to nodes and (respectively) as a single line of
 *         space-separated integers: -1 6. Note: Recall that the actual length
 *         of each edge is , and we print as the distance to any node that's
 *         unreachable from .
