SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers, without involving passwords. The steps below will walk you through generating an SSH key and adding the public key to your “*” account.

Step 1:
	Check for SSH Keys:
	ls -al ~/.ssh

	Files Could be , if present go to Step3
	id_dsa.pub
		id_ecdsa.pub
		id_ed25519.pub
		id_rsa.pub

Step2 :
	Generate a new SSH Key

	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	Generating public/private rsa key pair.
	Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/*/.ssh/id_rsa):
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	Enter same passphrase again:
	Your identification has been saved in /Users/*/.ssh/id_rsa.
	Your public key has been saved in /Users/*/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
	The key fingerprint is:
	 *@LocalMachine
	The key's randomart image is:
	
	Check if File exists:
	ls -al ~/.ssh/
	total 120
	drwx------   5 user  staff    170 Jul 23 18:59 .
	drwxr-xr-x+ 42 user  staff   1428 Jul 23 09:47 ..
	-rw-------   1 user  staff   1679 Jul 23 18:59 id_rsa
	-rw-r--r--   1 user  staff    421 Jul 23 18:59 id_rsa.pub
	-rw-r--r--   1 user  staff  49651 Jul 20 10:49 known_hosts

	Id_rsa.pub contains your HostName

Step3: Copy files to Main Servers

	scp /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@*:/tmp
	scp /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@*:/tmp
	scp /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@*:/tmp
	scp /Users/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@*:/tmp


Step4: Logon  to the main server and add to the Authorized Keys

	-bash-3.2$ ls -ltr /tmp/id_rsa.pub
	-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 421 Jul 24 02:01 /tmp/id_rsa.pub
	-bash-3.2$ cd .ssh  <if directory doesn’t exist create it>
	-bash-3.2$ pwd
		/home/devo/user/.ssh
	-bash-3.2$ cp /tmp/id_rsa.pub .
	-bash-3.2$ cat id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys
